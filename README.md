# Emotion Detection System

An emotion recognition backend built with **Python** and **OpenCV** to classify facial expressions in real timeâ€”no UI included.

---

##  Overview
This project captures live video input and processes it using OpenCV, and applies an emotion classification model to detect emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection and image preprocessing  
- Implements machine learning model(s) for emotion classification  
- Designed as a **backend-only** system (no graphical user interface)

---

##  Features
- Real-time face detection and emotion classification from live camera feed or static images  
- Clean, modular Python codebase suitable for integration into larger analytics pipelines  
- Easily extensible to add new emotion labels or model architectures

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- TensorFlow for model implementation

---

##  How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arindam221199/Emotion-Detection-System
   cd Emotion-Detection-System

2. Run emotion detection:
```bash
python main.py
